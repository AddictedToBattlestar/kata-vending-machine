# Vending Machine Kata

## Overview

This kata has been written in JavaScript using the revealing module pattern. Opening the SpecRunner.html file in your browser should allow you to see the unit tests execute the underlying code to demonstrate its functionality.

Alternatively (if you have Chrome installed as a browser), you can execute these tests with Karma by running the commands `npm install` and then `npm test`.

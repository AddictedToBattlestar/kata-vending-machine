# Vending Machine Kata

## Overview

This kata has been written in JavaScript using the revealing module pattern. Opening the SpecRunner.html file in your browser should allow you to see the unit tests execute the underlying code to demonstrate its functionality.

Alternatively, if you have run `npm install` and then `npm test` Karma has been setup as a test runner to provide results for the same tests. You will need to have Chrome installed as I am using that as the browser of choice for where these tests should be executed.
